# 🗺️ **Recommendation-System-For-Tourist-Routes-Using-Fuzzy-Logic-In-The-Arequipa-City**

### 📅 **Duration**: April 2021 - October 2021  
### 🏫 **Associated with**: Universidad Nacional de San Agustín de Arequipa  

---

## 📝 **Project Description**  
This project aims to transform the tourism experience in Arequipa by implementing an innovative recommendation system for tourist routes. Leveraging **fuzzy logic** and user evaluations, it optimizes the planning of personalized tours while considering critical factors such as budget, available time, and user preferences.

The system not only enhances the tourist's experience but also promotes lesser-known locations, boosting local tourism in a context heavily impacted by the pandemic.

## 🚀 **Key Features**

### **1. Intelligent Fuzzy Logic**  
- **Cost Estimation**: Precise calculations to adjust recommendations based on the user’s budget.  
- **Flexibility in Constraints**: Adapts to time limitations and personal preferences.

### **2. Advanced Recommendation System**  
- **Tourist Reviews**: Uses previous ratings to suggest top destinations.  
- **Personalization**: Adjusts routes to maximize user satisfaction.

### **3. Dynamic Interactive Mapping**  
- **Visualization with Allegro 5**: Generates interactive maps with optimized routes.  
- **Points of Interest**: Connects destinations through detailed and efficient routes.

### **4. Resource Optimization**  
- **Route Start and End Points**: Planned routes begin at the Plaza de Armas and end at the Basilica Cathedral of Arequipa.  
- **Strategic Stops**: Includes recommendations for lunch in traditional restaurants.
